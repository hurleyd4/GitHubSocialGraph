# GitHubSocialGraph
3rd year software engineering project that retrieves data from a github account and displays it as a visualisation
The information is supplied by my gitapi.py file. It is then read from the json files produced on my github account to be used for the visualisation.
Unfortunately this makes it so that it is not possible to alter the data without the ability to push to my github account.
I was unable to find an improve way of incorporating this.
